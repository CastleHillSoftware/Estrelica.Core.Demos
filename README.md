The demos in this solution provide examples for using <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/index.html" target="_blank">Estrelica.Core</a> to build your own .NET projects to implement integration activities with Archer.

These are the demo applications referenced in the <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/getting_started.html" target="_blank">Getting Started with Estrelica.Core</a> article.  Please refer to that article for info about accessing the Estrelica.Core package via Nuget.  Details about configuring your license key and connecting Estrelica.Core to your Archer instance can be found in the <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/connecting_to_archer.html" target="_blank">Connecting to Archer</a> article.

### Archer Configuration Expectations

Since every Archer deployment is different, some of these demos may fail to run to completion in your Archer environment.

Notably, the <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/Content_demo.html" target="_blank">Content Demo</a>, <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/Metadata_demo.html" target="_blank">Metadata Demo</a> and <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/Section_Name_Repair.html" target="_blank">Section Name Repair</a> applications (demonstrating how to work with Archer content and metadata) make use of the "Policies", "Control Standards" and "Applications" applications.

These applications were chosen for the demos because they are included by Archer in all standard deployments, so it is anticipated that these demos will run unmodified on most Archer systems.

However, these applications (and/or the levels and fields they contain) may well have been deleted or renamed by an administrator in your Archer environment.  This will cause the corresponding code which attempts to resolve these entities by name to fail.

If you encounter any errors when running these demos, simply modify the code as needed to align with whatever names are appropriate for your environment.

Furthermore, there's nothing special about the specific applications selected as far as these demos are concerned.  You can easily modify the code to use whatever applications/levels/fields you'd like to work with in your environment.

### Overview

Information about all of the demos can be found in the <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/Estrelica.Core.Demos.html" target="_blank">Estrelica.Core.Demos</a> article.

<a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/Content_demo.html" target="_blank">Content Demo</a> and <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/Metadata_demo.html" target="_blank">Metadata Demo</a> don't really do anything productive.  The code is the important thing here, showing *how* to perform content- and metadata-related activities with Estrelica.Core.  Don't expect to be amazed by the console output scrolling by onscreen, you should instead focus on the code itself to understand how these activities are implemented.  The demonstrated techniques can then be adapted in your own code to implement whatever content and metadata interactions are needed in your integration work.

The other applications (<a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/Datafeed_demo.html" target="_blank">Datafeed Explorer</a>, <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/Report_demo.html" target="_blank">Report Explorer</a>, <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/CHUM_tool.html" target="_blank">CHUM Tool</a>, <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/UserAccessProcessor.html" target="_blank">User Access Processor</a>, <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/Section_Name_Repair.html" target="_blank">Section Name Repair</a> and <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/Workflow_Activity_Report.html" target="_blank">Workflow Activity Report</a>) are functional applications which perform specific productive actions.

As the name implies, the <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/Datafeed_demo.html" target="_blank">Datafeed Explorer</a> demo shows how to access the datafeeds configured in your Archer environment to examine their statuses and run history, and how to execute datafeeds.  This demo application does not depend on any particular Archer modules or content being present in your Archer environment, as it works directly with whatever Archer Datafeeds are available, regardless of their configuration.  The same is true of the <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/Report_demo.html" target="_blank">Report Explorer</a>, which performs similar activities for whatever Archer Reports you have in your environment.

The <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/CHUM_tool.html" target="_blank">CHUM Tool</a> (CastleHill User Management) and <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/UserAccessProcessor.html" target="_blank">User Access Processor</a> demos each perform similar functions, asserting group membership for users via an external process which fulfills change requests via the API.  Each depends on specific Archer configuration to implement these change requests -- two new fields added to the standard Archer "Contacts" application in the case of the **CHUM Tool**, and a new Workflow-enabled ODA in the case of the **User Access Processor**.  The details of each are described in the comments of their respective Program.cs files.

<a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/Workflow_Activity_Report.html" target="_blank">Workflow Activity Report</a> is a prototype application developed on spec by CastleHill Risk Management, eventually turned into a full production application for a customer.  It demonstrates how to use <a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/api/Estrelica.Archer.Content.IArcherContentAccess.html#collapsible-Estrelica_Archer_Content_IArcherContentAccess_ContentHistory" target="_blank">ContentHistory</a> to evaluate Advanced Workflow activities and resulting field content changes.

<a href="https://castlehillsoftware.github.io/Estrelica.Core.Demos/articles/Section_Name_Repair.html" target="_blank">Section Name Repair</a> is a special case, comprising two projects which perform the same activity (repairing some misspelled Policy Section Name values based on a hypothetical requirement scenario).  These two projects are intended to illustrate the difference between implementing an integration application the traditional way (writing code to interact directly with the Archer APIs) versus implementing the same functional requirements using Estrelica.Core (with far less code and much more clarity).
